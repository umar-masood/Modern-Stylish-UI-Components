_______________________________________________

This collection of custom UI components redefines desktop application design in Qt. Every element has been hand-built with precision using C++ and Qt, and styled with the elegance of Qt Style Sheets (QSS) to evoke a modern, smooth, and responsive feel.
Below is a showcase of the components and their aesthetic purpose:

🧩 Core Components
===================
🔘 Button
--------------------------
Minimal yet powerful. This custom button is designed with elegant hover transitions, shadows, and support for icons. The Dialog_Button variant harmonizes seamlessly with dialogs, offering consistent styling across modals.

📥 ComboBox
------------
A modern take on a classic. Styled dropdowns with beautiful borders, soft shadows, and a graceful opening animation. Supports icons, themes, and custom delegates for rich content.

🔁 Toggle
--------------
A sleek switch component designed for simplicity and clarity. Inspired by mobile UX, this toggle provides smooth animations, color transitions, and intuitive control states.

📦 RoundedBox
--------------
Stylish containers with soft, rounded corners and customizable backgrounds. Ideal for wrapping content in modern "card-like" layouts.

📑 Menu
-------------
A reimagined menu system that uses transparency, icons, and soft shadows to create a floating, elevated UI experience. Fully theme-adaptable.

🎛️ Input & Feedback
===================
